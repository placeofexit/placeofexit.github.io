There is an ancient and fundamental moral dispute in ethical philosophy, which can be roughly characterized thusly:

####Socrates:
No person knowingly does bad; evil is synonymous with ignorance. [Expand](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1672/1672-h/1672-h.htm)

[Augustine](http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greeks-us/augustine_plato-socrates.asp?pg=2)

[Aquinus](http://www.todayscatholicworld.com/willful-ignorance.htm)

####Christianity:
We are all in sin, and sin is [the existential state of] knowingly rejecting the good (often God or Christ).

This distinction might be brushed off as overly reductive for several reasons. First, neither Socrates nor the Christian tradition holds their position as an empirical claim. Rather, these are pragmatic ways of framing evil which encourage different ways of thinking about it and addressing it.

Second, we might protest that we are dealing here with two different conceptions of knowledge (or else of "wrong").

Kierkegaard brings these into direct dialogue, lands himself on a pretty orthodox interpretation of sin, but interprets it into a responsive/spontaneous ethic, which I find interesting.

Ta-Nehisi Coates: p.98 brings this issue into the context of racism / discrimination, the way that an impossible ideal of racism (an individual knowingly denying a person’s personhood, analogous to sin) obscures the operations of systematic racism.

“There was my sense that this woman was pulling rank. I knew for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action” (94).

“But my experience in this world has been that the people who believe themselves to be white are obsessed with the politics of personal exoneration. And the word racist, to them, conjures, if not a tobacco-spitting oaf, then something just as fantastic—an orc, troll, or gorgon. ‘I’m not a racist,’ an entertainer once insisted after being filmed repeatedly yelling at a heckler: ‘He’s a nigger! He’s a nigger!’” (97).

Followed by Nixon to Strom Thurmond: “Strom is no racist.” Inability to find blame in lynch mobs: “persons unknown.”

“In 1957, the white residents of Levittown, Pennsylvania, argued for their right to keep their town segregated. ‘As moral, religious and law-abiding citizens,’ the group wrote, ‘we feel that we are unprejudiced and undiscriminating in our wish to keep our community a closed community.’ This was the attempt to commit a shameful act while escaping all sanction, and I raise it to show you that there was no golden era when evildoers did their business and loudly proclaimed it as such” (p.98).

The way oppression influences this discussion is interesting to me. [Worth revisiting the feminist Kantian from Elise’s class.] I generally want to fall somewhere in the middle between Socrates and Sin. I am convinced that there is some kind of knowledge involved here: the knowledge that Coates describes as the white woman ‘pulling rank’ in the Upper West Side, knowing she would never do that on Flatbush. A very unrefined kind of knowledge, this sensing-if-not-knowing, generally unexpressed, arguably unconscious, but one which a little bit of Socratic questioning could bring one to recollect. [Evan Thompson, or somebody, names these kinds of knowledge or thought: conceptual normativity and something...one being discursive, but both being conceptual, both involving an understanding of rules, difference, privilege, etc. The same knowledge involved in playing football as in pulling rank, playing in the field of systemic racism.]

Perhaps this is really all the knowledge that is required for sin, and we should follow Kierkegaard in decrying Christendom for preaching our innocence.

Coates implies a kind of knowledge, even while denying the helpfulness of ‘racism’ as understood by the people that think they are white: “The mettle that it takes to look away from the horror of our prison system, from police forces transformed into armies, from the long war against the black body, is not forged overnight. This is the practiced habit of jabbing out one’s eyes and forgetting the work of one’s hands. To acknowledge these horrors means turning away from the brightly rendered version of your country as it has always declared itself and turning toward something murkier and unknown. It is still too difficult for most // Americans to do this” (p.98-99).

“forgetting the work of one’s hands,” literally obscuring one’s agency in the whole thing (Heideggerian conscience), forgetting that we killed Christ

Kierkegaard’s solution is repentance, but nothing so analogous in social justice. We can repent our country, our history—we can (and should) acknowledge our privilege—but, as with sin, all the penance in the world can’t take away the basic fact of it. But for Kierkegaard, the final salvation is a matter of faith. It’s up to Christ. Coates, I imagine, would have none of this.

Real interesting part later: “By the time I visited those battlefields, I knew that they had been retrofitted as the staging ground for a great deception, and this was my only security, because they could no longer insult me by lying to me. I knew—and the most important thing I knew was that, somewhere deep with them [sic], they knew too. I like to think that knowing might have kept me from endangering you, that hav-//ing understood and acknowledged the anger, I could control it. I like to think that it could have allowed me to speak the needed words to the woman and then walk away. I like to think this, but I can’t promise it. The struggle is really all I have for you because it is the only portion of this world under your control” (106-7).

[Don’t necessarily need an answer for this piece, tho worth exploring the slippery nature of this “knowledge” for those that hold it, the way that it expresses itself as bullshit, that it is so tied up in power; it is not denied out of true belief, but out of a (tacitly understood, vaguely grasped) sense that one will benefit from denying it. The politics of personal exoneration are not concerned with uncovering the true structure of our society; this structure simply doesn’t play a part in the claims (and even genuine fears!) of the ‘attack on white America.’]
